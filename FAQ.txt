A1. How do I open and close an archive?
  At the main page, press "OPEN" and select an archive file (.aaz) in the file-
  browser. The archive appears as a green box at the top right corner named as 
  the archive top level folder name. 
  The content of the folder can be expanded by pressing the folder.
  Multiple archives can be opened at the same time by pression "OPEN".
  An archive can be closed by right-clicking the folder name and selecting 
  "CLOSE".

A2. How do I save an archive?
  Data is saved in archives as a single file named aaz. Select "SAVE PROJECT" 
  in the main menu to save data. The current folders and data will be shown in 
  the left window, while the stucture of the new archive is shown in the right 
  window. To define a new archive you must start by adding a new top level 
  folder by dragging from "Add Folder" to the right window. 
  You may now add new folders or drag data from the left window to the new 
  archive. There are three types of folders: standard folders, data folders 
  and video folders. Standard folders may contain all type of folders, while 
  data folders must contain data-files and video folders must contain video
  files. An archive cannot be saved if there are any empty data or video
  folders. To rename a folder right click the folder-name. 
  When the folder structure is complete press "Save" and specify the location  
  and name for the archive. 
  Note: Saving an archive may take some time, observe the progress bar to check 
  when saving is completed. The ActivityPresenter application should not be 
  terminated before saving is complete.  
  Note also that the saved archive is not automatically opened in 
  ActivityPresenter. To work with the new archive you must manually open the 
  new archive.  

A3. How is data stored in an archive?
  Data is stored in an uncompressed zip file named aaz (AutoActiveZip). Sensor 
  data is stored in parquet files, while videos are stored in their original 
  format, as they are already compressed. For further information, please see
  the "Data Handling" section in the paper.md file in the repository:
